         <div class="intro">
        <p>Hi again 👋🏻</p> 
        </div>
        
        

        <div class="info">
                

            <p><br>I'm a first-year student studying UX-Design & Requirement management.  
                I have always been a creative person with an eye for the small details, 
                but also very curious about the human nature and why people behave the way they do.
               The fact that i could combine these two sides led me to a career switch, and now
            i'm finally on my UX-jurney.</br></p>
            
                
               <p>I have a bachelor's degree in social science and have many years of work experience as a social worker.
                I have an interest in psychology and a natural driving force in wanting to understand people,
                 their needs, challenges and helping them find ways to overcome them.</br></p>
                
                <p>
                My strengths are my creativity, ability to put myself in other people's situations, 
                and solving problems that might seem impossible at first.</p>

                <p>Little tidbits about me:</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>🔸 I love weight training and spend 4-5 days/week at the gym.</p>
                <p>🔸 I'm a foodie. I love to talk about food, cook food and of course eat food.<br></p>
                <p>🔸 I love taking photos of sunsets and probably have over 100 photos of sunsets saved in my phone.<br></p>
